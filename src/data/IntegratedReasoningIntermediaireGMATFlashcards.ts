    question: "Two-Part Analysis: A company is considering two investment options. Option A yields 8% annually compounded quarterly, while Option B yields 8.2% annually compounded annually. For an investment of $10,000 over 3 years, which option provides the greater return and by how much?",
    answer: "Option A; $25.36",
    explication: "For Option A: $10,000(1 + 0.08/4)^12 = $10,000(1.02)^12 = $10,000 Ã— 1.26824 = $12,682.40. For Option B: $10,000(1.082)^3 = $10,000 Ã— 1.26657 = $12,665.70. Option A yields $12,682.40 - $12,665.70 = $16.70 more.",
