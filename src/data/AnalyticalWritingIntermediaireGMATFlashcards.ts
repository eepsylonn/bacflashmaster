    question: "Analyze this argument: 'Studies show that employees who telecommute have 22% higher productivity than those who work in the office. Therefore, our company should implement a full telecommuting policy to maximize productivity.'",
    answer: "This argument fails to consider several important factors: Whether the studies controlled for job type, employee selection bias (perhaps only high performers were allowed to telecommute), measurement methodology for productivity, and whether results would translate to this specific company's context. It also ignores potential drawbacks like reduced collaboration or communication challenges.",
    explication: "For intermediate AWA analysis, critically evaluate the research methodology implied in the argument. Consider how selection bias might affect results and whether the conclusion overgeneralizes from limited contexts.",

    question: "Critique this policy recommendation: 'The city council should ban single-use plastic bags in all retail establishments because similar bans in other cities have reduced plastic waste in landfills by up to 30%.'",
    answer: "While the data point is compelling, the argument has several weaknesses: It doesn't address potential economic impacts on businesses or consumers, consumer behavior changes (switch to paper bags which have different environmental impacts), enforcement costs, or whether the 30% reduction is consistent across different cities with varying demographics and recycling infrastructure. The 'up to 30%' phrasing also suggests cherry-picking the best results.",
    explication: "For intermediate AWA, consider both the direct evidence presented and the broader systemic impacts of proposed policies. Analyze whether the evidence adequately supports the specific policy recommendation, including implementation challenges.",

    question: "Evaluate this argument: 'Company Y's new product will be successful because it incorporates the three features most requested by customers in our market survey.'",
    answer: "This argument makes several questionable assumptions: That stated preferences in surveys translate to purchasing behavior; that the survey sample was representative of the target market; that customer preferences are the only determinant of product success (ignoring pricing, competition, marketing, etc.); and that implementation of these features meets customer expectations in quality. The argument also ignores the possibility that these features may conflict with each other or increase costs beyond what customers are willing to pay.",
    explication: "For intermediate AWA, analyze the gap between market research and market success. Consider methodological limitations of surveys and the multifaceted nature of product success beyond feature lists.",

    question: "Analyze the reasoning: 'Our competitor's product contains ingredient X, which some studies have linked to minor health issues. Therefore, we should emphasize in our marketing that our product does not contain ingredient X.'",
    answer: "This argument has ethical and logical concerns: It potentially exaggerates health risks without proper context ('some studies' and 'minor issues' suggest limited evidence); it may create unnecessary health anxiety for competitive advantage; it doesn't establish whether the concentration of ingredient X in the competitor's product reaches levels of concern; and it assumes customers will value the absence of X without considering whether removing X compromises other product attributes like effectiveness or flavor.",
    explication: "For intermediate AWA, consider the ethical dimensions of arguments, especially when they leverage fear or incomplete scientific information. Analyze whether the implied marketing strategy fairly represents the available evidence.",

    question: "Critique this educational policy: 'To improve mathematical proficiency, schools should double the time spent on math instruction, as countries with more instructional time in mathematics consistently outperform our country on international assessments.'",
    answer: "This argument oversimplifies international educational comparisons. It fails to consider differences in teaching methods, cultural attitudes toward education, socioeconomic factors, and overall educational system design. Simply allocating more time without addressing quality of instruction may be ineffective. The policy also doesn't address the opportunity cost - what subjects would receive less instructional time? Additionally, correlation between instructional time and performance doesn't establish causation.",
    explication: "For intermediate AWA, analyze comparative claims carefully, especially international comparisons that may ignore crucial contextual differences. Consider system-level impacts of proposed changes, including tradeoffs and opportunity costs.",
