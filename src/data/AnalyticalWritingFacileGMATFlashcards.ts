    question: "Analyze this argument: 'The city should invest in expanding its public transportation system because cities with extensive public transportation have lower rates of traffic congestion.'",
    answer: "This argument assumes a causal relationship between public transportation and reduced congestion, but correlation doesn't imply causation. It fails to consider other factors that might influence congestion levels or whether these cities had lower congestion before implementing public transportation.",
    explication: "In AWA, identify the argument's conclusion, premises, and unstated assumptions. Look for logical fallacies like assuming correlation implies causation, as in this example. A strong analysis would point out alternative explanations and missing information.",

    question: "Evaluate this reasoning: 'Since implementing a wellness program three years ago, Company X has seen employee sick days decrease by 15%. Therefore, all companies should implement similar wellness programs to reduce absenteeism.'",
    answer: "This argument overgeneralizes from a single case study. It fails to consider differences between companies, alternative explanations for the decrease in sick days, and whether the 15% reduction justifies the program's cost. It also assumes correlation implies causation.",
    explication: "For AWA, look for hasty generalizations where conclusions are drawn too broadly from limited evidence. Consider whether the sample size (one company) is sufficient to make universal recommendations.",

    question: "Analyze the flaws in this argument: 'The local newspaper's readership has declined 30% since social media became popular. Therefore, social media is causing the decline of print journalism.'",
    answer: "This argument assumes correlation implies causation. While the decline coincides with social media's rise, other factors might be responsible, such as changing consumer preferences, increased digital news options, or economic factors affecting subscription rates. The argument also fails to define 'popular' or establish the timeline precisely.",
    explication: "For AWA, identify post hoc fallacies where events that occur in sequence are assumed to have a causal relationship. Consider alternative explanations and request more specific evidence.",

    question: "Critique this proposal: 'To increase test scores, the school district should extend the school day by one hour, as students who spend more time studying typically achieve higher scores.'",
    answer: "This proposal assumes that more time in school automatically translates to more effective studying. It doesn't address the quality of education, student engagement, or diminishing returns from longer hours. Additionally, it generalizes from typical correlations without considering factors like teacher fatigue or student burnout.",
    explication: "In AWA, challenge simplistic solutions that don't address potential complications or side effects. Consider whether the proposed solution actually addresses the root cause of the problem.",

    question: "Evaluate this argument: 'Restaurant Z's food must be exceptional because it is always crowded with customers.'",
    answer: "This argument erroneously equates popularity with quality. There are many alternative explanations for a restaurant being crowded: convenient location, low prices, large portion sizes, effective marketing, limited competition in the area, or even social media trends. The argument fails to consider these alternatives.",
    explication: "For AWA, identify when arguments conflate popularity with quality or merit. Consider other factors that could explain the observed evidence and point out the logical gap between the evidence (crowded restaurant) and the conclusion (exceptional food).",
